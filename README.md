# FM_Broadcasting
Transmission and receiving FM modulated signals using Matlab and the National Instruments (NI) USRP kit.

In this project, we transmit and receive our signals as well as transmit and receive commercial signals.
The project is divided into two main sections:
1. Mono Audio stream
2. Stereo Audio stream
Where in each section we transmit and receive the signal.
